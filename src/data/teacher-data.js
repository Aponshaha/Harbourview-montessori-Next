That honed me to be resilient, calm and collected.",
    subDesc: "I consider Education as one of the biggest investments in life. I am a life-long learner and an advocate of “Knowledge is power”. One of the motivations in coming here was to send myself and my two sons to a First world country standard of education. I also believe that Education is not just confined to 4 corners of a classroom and pages of books, but learning - education also comes from experience and practical life. I am so delighted, thankful and humbled that Harbourview Montessori has given me the opportunity to live my long-time dream of becoming an Early Childhood Educator. I am happy and very eager to learn more of the theories and concepts of early childhood education; as well, as I am excited to put in into practice every day through learning and experiencing with each of the children in the school. I am also currently connected with Canadian Red Cross as Emergency Management Coordinator.",
    cDesc: "I love to wander to see wonder. This is guided by my mantra of ‘Nobility of Purpose.’ I love meeting new people, and I am always ready to be of service to others and try to make a difference in their lives. This makes my work at Harbourview Montessori more meaningful. Sharing each day with the children helps me to see wonders and appreciate many things. Additionally as a ‘wanderer,’ I enjoy travelling as I search to answer the ‘Whys’ through my exploration of the world. I am happy and excited to explore the world of early childhood!",

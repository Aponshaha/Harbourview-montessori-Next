I am so delighted, thankful and humbled that Harbourview Montessori has given me the opportunity to live my long-time dream of becoming an Early Childhood Educator. I am happy and very eager to learn more of the theories and concepts of early childhood education; as well, as I am excited to put in into practice every day through learning and experiencing with each of the children in the school. I am also currently connected with Canadian Red Cross as Emergency Management Coordinator.",

My teaching philosophy involves creating a safe and kind space while creating learning opportunities for the students. I want students, whether they are struggling or excelling, to know that they can achieve anything that they set their minds to. The Montessori environment is amazing at letting me do just this. Making the transition to a Montessori school and philosophy of teaching has been one of the best decisions I’ve made. I love the calm spaces, parent-teacher-student community and the mixed aged classrooms. When I’m not at school I enjoy spending time with my husband, nephews, niece, two dogs, and three cats.",

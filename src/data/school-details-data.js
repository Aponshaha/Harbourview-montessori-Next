        descriptionOne: 'Harbourvschool1iew Montessori was born from a dream. This dream was to create the most beautiful, calm and enriching environment for young children. It was to create a place in which children would be supported in their development, learn according to their individual learning styles and temperaments, and come to know that they have unique gifts to be developed and realized.

Today, we have 4 beautiful classrooms, over 2 acres of wild and landscaped grounds, and a staff that is dedicated to our goal of nurturing, inspiring and supporting the social, emotional, physical and intellectual development of the children in our care. As founder, I feel a deep sense of satisfaction when I walk down our hallway, hearing and seeing signs of joyful learning. I feel a real sense of contentment when we hear, over and over again, parents praising us for our peaceful atmosphere, our open and professional communication, and the rich and varied curriculum we offer to our students. Finally, I feel a sense of humility when I realize that, together, we are helping to raise children to be kind, loving, generous and self-actualized individuals who will see and create beauty in our world. I am happy to say that, after almost 20 years, we are as strong in our core beliefs as we were in the beginning. Thank you to the incredible support from our staff, parents and, most importantly, our students.',
